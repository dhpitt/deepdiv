# DeepDiv: Active Learning Using Representation-Similarity-Based Uncertainty Sampling
This repo stores the code for my newest project. I'm expanding on two very cool papers, 

### Diversify and Disambiguate: Learning from Underspecified Data (Lee et al.)

and 

### Similarity of Neural Network Representations Revisited (Kornblith et al.)
